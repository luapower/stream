## `stream = require'stream'`

Composable streams for string and cdata-buffer-based I/O.

Streams are the glue between low-level I/O APIs and high-level network
protocols and filters.

A stream wraps a low-level cdata-buffer-based I/O API and provides various
higher-level I/O APIs that network protocols, image decoders, decompressors
etc. are more comfortable working with.

Streams can be chained together.
